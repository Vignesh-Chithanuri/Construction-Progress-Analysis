🏗️ Construction Progress Analysis | SQL & Python Project
📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing construction project performance using SQL and Python. It evaluates project progress, budget efficiency, delays, risk levels, and issue patterns to help stakeholders make data-driven decisions. The analysis simulates a real-world construction management scenario.

🎯 Objectives

Analyze construction project timelines and completion status

Measure budget efficiency and cost overruns

Identify delay patterns across project stages

Evaluate risk levels and issue impact

Provide actionable insights for project optimization

🛠️ Tools & Technologies

Python (Pandas, NumPy)

SQL (Data querying & analysis)

Matplotlib & Seaborn (Data Visualization)

Statistics & Hypothesis Testing

Jupyter Notebook

📂 Dataset Overview

The dataset contains detailed information about construction projects:

ProjectID – Unique project identifier

ProjectName – Name of the project

Stage / SubStage – Project phase

StartDate, PlannedEndDate, ActualEndDate

ProgressPercentage – Work completion level

BudgetAllocated, BudgetUtilized

RiskLevel – Low / Medium / High

IssuesReported – Number of issues logged

📊 Key Insights

High-risk projects show greater budget variance

Certain stages are more prone to delays

Projects with more issues tend to exceed budgets

Progress percentage strongly impacts project status
